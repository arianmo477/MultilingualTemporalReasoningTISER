## Experiments and Checkpoints

Due to GitHub’s file size limitations, trained model checkpoints and experiment artifacts are not stored directly in this repository.

All LoRA adapters and experiment outputs (English, Italian, and German models) are available at the following Google Drive folder:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g31okqn2xN94ZKArpkxfPvbkNpQ54arM?usp=drive_link

The folder contains the final trained adapters and corresponding experiment directories required to reproduce the reported results.

Note: Only the adapter weights are required for inference. Intermediate training states (e.g., optimizer files and partial checkpoints) are included solely for reproducibility purposes.
