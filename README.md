## TISER - Multilingual Extension

### Learning to Reason Over Time: Timeline Self-Reflection for Improved Temporal Reasoning in Language Models

This repository contains the **multilingual extension** for the TISER dataset from the paper (ACL 2025 Main): [Learning to Reason Over Time: Timeline Self-Reflection for Improved Temporal Reasoning in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05258).

TISER incorporates a multi-stage inference pipeline that combines explicit reasoning, timeline construction, and iterative self-reflection. The key idea behind our approach is to empower LLMs to adapt by scaling their internal reasoning process during inference. TISER enables models to systematically organize temporal information, verify their inferences, and refine their outputs.

### 🌍 Multilingual Extension

This repository extends TISER to **multiple languages**:
- 🇮🇹 **Italian (it)**
- 🇮🇷 **Persian/Farsi (fa)**
- 🇩🇪 **German (de)**

**Key Features:**
- ✅ High-quality neural machine translation with entity preservation
- ✅ Language-specific temporal expression normalization
- ✅ Chain-of-thought structure preservation across languages
- ✅ Comprehensive validation and quality control
- ✅ Ready-to-use scripts for the complete translation pipeline

📖 **See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for detailed instructions!**

## Train Data Format

Each entry in the [TISER train dataset](data/TISER_train.json) is a JSON object containing six fields: `dataset_name`, `question_id`, `question`, `answer`, `prompt`, and `output`. The `question` field specifies the temporal question being asked, while `answer` contains the expected short-form response (e.g., an entity or number). The `prompt` provides detailed instructions for a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning process with reflection, guiding the model to reason step-by-step, extract temporal events, reflect on its logic, and produce a final answer. The `output` field contains the full model-generated response adhering to this reasoning format. This structure supports supervised training of models to perform temporal reasoning and answer generation.

## Test Data Format

Each test example in the [TISER test dataset](data/TISER_test.json) is represented as a single JSON object containing five fields: `dataset_name`, which specifies the split or task; `question_id`, a unique identifier for the query; `question`, the temporal reasoning prompt itself; `prompt`, which embeds the full Chain-of-Thought template (including `<reasoning>`, `<timeline>`, `<reflection>` and `<answer>` tags) that the model should follow when generating its response; and `answer`, the held-out ground-truth output against which the model’s `<answer>` section is evaluated. Unlike the training format, there is no `output` field in test records, since models read the `prompt` and produce only an `<answer>` that is scored directly against the provided `answer` key.
